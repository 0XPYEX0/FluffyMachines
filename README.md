# FluffyMachines

These are some thrown together machines made by me for fun :)
I pretty much add whatever comes to mind, is suggested by me, or other addons don't want to add.

Not all of these machines are aimed for performance, so make sure you check their timings!

Custom item settings can be changed in `plugins/Slimefun/Items.yml`

## Machines
**Auto Crafting Table**: Automatically crafts vanilla recipes

**Auto Ancient Altar**: Automatically crafts Ancient Altar recipes

**Water Sprinkler**: Electric sprinkler that grows crows in a 2 block radius

**Backpack Loader**: Moves items from inventory to backpack

**Backpack Unloader**: Empties backpack into inventory

## Generators
**Crank Generator**: Multiblock machine that generates power when clicked

## Items
**Watering Can**: Waters plants and trees to speed up their growth

**Helicopter Hat**: Allows you to float upwards

## Misc
**Ender Chest Extraction Node**: Moves items from ender chest to a chest

**Ender Chest Insertion Node**: Moves items from a chest to an ender chest

*The extraction and insertion nodes do no stack items in inventories, that costs more performance and can be handled by cargo.
